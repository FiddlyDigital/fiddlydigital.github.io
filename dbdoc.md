### DbDoc
DbDoc is a Documentation Generation and Navigation Tool for SQLServer Databases.

It's designed to act as a lightning-fast referance to develop for and against your Databases.

![DbDocTableExample](/img/dbdoc1.png){:class="img-responsive"}

It's a 2 part System:

* 'Generator' is a Desktop Application that reads your SQLServer databases and outputs Documentation Models
* 'Navigator' is a Web Application that reads those models and allows you to navigate them in a clear and lightning-fast way!

#### Who is it for?
DbDoc is aimed at anybody who interacts with a SQLServer Database. Whether you're a one-man dev shop or you're a DBA, Web Developer or Report Creator in a large organisation - you'll find your workflow simplified and electrified! 

It was designed with 2 particular use-cases in mind:
* When you have 1 or 2 huge databases that have developed *organically* over-time 
* When you have many small-medium databases that inter-connect

#### What does it do?
DbDoc serves as an 'all-in-one' referance point for:

* Development, Refactoring and Administration of your Databases
* Developing against those Databases in your .Net applications and Services

##### Generator - The Desktop Application
Allows you the generate documents models quickly and painlessly.
There's both a command line interface AND a traditional GUI so no matter whether you want to manually craft your docs or automatically generate them - we have you covered.

##### Navigator - The Web Application
Allows you to see every facet of every object in your databases.

You can easily traverse a table or view and it's properties, columns, indexes, and dependencies - or quickly zero in on where a particular Stored Procedure or Function is used.

You can get a real sense of exactly where everything in your database sits and how it connects and interacts with other objects.

There's even a robust search and filter system that allows you to find absolutely anything!
