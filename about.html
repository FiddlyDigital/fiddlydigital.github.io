<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    I'm Phil - I'm extremely passionate about Technology, Music, and the extroardinary fusion of the two.
</p>

<h3>Software and I</h3>
<p>
    To me, software is an exciting craft. 
    Partly Science, Partly Art, and partly Sorcery.
    It is a difficult, but rewarding vocation.
    Better still when it's applied to a an interesting problem-domain, like Health, Communication or Finance!
    I'm quite proud of the projects I've worked, and I'm looking forward to completing many more!
</p>
<p>
    I'd consider myself a craftsman programmer.
    I am constantly on the look-out for new challenges, new techniques and to refine my skills.
    I honestly believe that you're never done learning, and relish reading tech and programming books + articles.
</p>
<p>
    I'd also consider myself a 'polyglot' programmer. 
    Professionaly I've written code in SQL, Java, Python, C#/.Net, Javascript, Silverlight, Flash/Flex and Coldfusion, hosted across a number of differant environments.
    I regulary write front-end and back-end code, I'm comfortable database diving and also quite capable with Design and UX.
</p>
<p>
    I've been fortunate enough to work across a large breadth of the industry; 
    everything from 6-man start-ups to 6000+ employee Enterprise environments.
    Along the way I've met some amazing people and learned from some true professionals.
    Hopefully I do them justice presenting the ever-evolving fruit of our efforts here.
