<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>
    I'm Phil, a FullStack Developer from Dublin, Ireland
</p>    
    
<p>
    I'm extremely passionate about Technology and software.
    To me, software is an exciting craft - equal parts Science, Art and Sorcery.
</p>

<p>
    I've been fortunate enough to work across a large breadth of the industry. 
    I've worked in a lot of environments, from 6-people start-ups to 6000+ employee Enterprise corporations.
    Along the way I've worked on some amazing projects and learned from some true professionals.
</p>

<p>
    I extremely enjoy my vocation and hope my works and words here give back (even in a small way!) to the excellent development communities I've had the pleasure of being a part of.
