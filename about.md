I'm Phil.

I'm a Software Enginner and Mentor, who's extremely passionate about Technology and Software.

To me, Software is an exciting craft - equal parts Science, Art and Sorcery.

I work at all levels of the Development life-cycle:
* Requirements Gathering
* Technical specifications
* Wire-Framing
* Design
* Proof of Concepts / Minimal Viable Products (MVPs)
* Development Iterations
* User Acceptance Testing
* Deployment

I'm familiar and comfortable working on the Client, Server and Database Levels - and everywhere in-between.

My current stack is Javascript (VueJS / AngularJS), .Net/C# Asp.NET (WebAPI/MVC() and Sql Server.

I've been fortunate enough to work across a large breadth of the Industry; from 6-people start-ups to 6000+ employee Enterprise corporations.
Along the way I've worked on some absolutely amazing projects and learned from some *true* professionals.
I hope to continue their trend of sharing Software tips and techniques so that other's can learn and go on to create great things.
