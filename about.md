### Who I am
I'm Phil, a FullStack Developer from Dublin, Ireland

I'm extremely passionate about Technology and software.
To me, software is an exciting craft - equal parts Science, Art and Sorcery.

I've been fortunate enough to work across a large breadth of the industry. 
I've worked in a lot of environments, from 6-people start-ups to 6000+ employee Enterprise corporations.
Along the way I've worked on some amazing projects and learned from some true professionals.
