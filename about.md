I'm Phil.

I'm a FullStack Developer. I work at all levels of the product development life-cycle - from requirements-gathering and design, right up to deployment.

I'm familiar and comfortable working on the Client, Server and Database Levels - and everywhere in between.
My current stack is Javascript (Vue2/AngularJS), .Net/C# and Sql Server.

I'm extremely passionate about Technology and software.
To me, software is an exciting craft - equal parts Science, Art and Sorcery.

I've been fortunate enough to work across a large breadth of the Industry.
I've worked in a lot of different environments, from 6-people start-ups to 6000+ employee Enterprise corporations.
Along the way I've worked on some amazing projects and learned from some *true* professionals.

I hope to continue their trend of sharing software tips and techniques so that other's can learn and go on to create great things.
